Setting up a development environment
====================================

#. Refer to :doc:`contributing` (section "Getting Started") for information of how to (1) either fork a repository, clone it,
   and install it for development purposes, or (2) set up the directory structure for your own Django app that will
   contribute to the Mantis framework.

#. Chose a development environment of your liking. Here is how you can setup 
   `PyCharm`_ Professional Edition in support of development for Django:
   * Start up PyCharm and enter your license information.
   * Before opening a project/folder, go to ``Configure -> Settings`` and adjust the following:
     - Use the search box in the settings dialog to find the place where you can configure the proxy settings:
     - Configure the python environment under "Project Interpreter" -> "Python Interpreters"
       Click on the "+", then on "Local..."
       Select ``<path_to_your_environment>/bin/python``, and click "Ok"
     - Click on "Ok" to close the settings window.
   * Open the project folder: select "Open Directory" and choose your source directories 
    
   * Before being able to run the django-mantis project, you have to adjust the "Run/Debug Confgurations" (wait for the indexer to finish...)
     - In the menubar, click on "Run" -> "Edit Configurations"
     - Select the "django-mantis" in the displayed tree on the left
     - In the right pane, add the following to the "Additional options:" ``--settings=mantis.settings.local_psql`` or ``--settings=mantis.settings.local``  

   * You should now be able to run the django server by clicking the play button.
