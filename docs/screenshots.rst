Screenshots
===========

To get an idea of what MANTIS currently provides, take a look at the following screenshots.

Login
-----

Django's standard login screen, rendered with the Grappelli skin
that is used by Mantis. You can customize Django to do
authentication differently (see the 
`Django documentation on customizing authentication`_.)

Viewing imported information objects
------------------------------------

The screenshot below shows the overview of imported information objects right
after import of MITRE's conversion of the 
`MITRE STIX conversion of APT-1 report`_. We imported the top-level STIX package
and the Appendix G with full indicators of compromise (i.e., Mandiant OpenIOC
is embedded into the STIX XML). The count shows a quite large number of objects,
and we obviously need a way to find our way around. So in the next step,
we filter the list a bit.

   The list of information objects (standard URL: ``/mantis/View/InfoObject``)


Filtering
---------

The filter box on the page showing the information object list allows filtering with respect
to several commonly used criteria. Here, we filter by information object type, and chose
the ``STIX_Package``.

   Filtering with respect to information object types

Filtering results for ``STIX_Packages`` yields two results: the package that represents
the top-level of the APT-1 report and the package that represents appendix G.

Viewing an info object
----------------------

Clicking on the STIX package for the top-level of the APT-1 report shows
MANTIS's representation of the info object:


.. figure:: images/mantis_view_mandiant_report_toplevel.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   View of STIX package presenting top-level of APT 1 report


* At the top, we have identifiying information.

* The bulk of the display in the center concerns
  the facts contained in the object (the color coding shows the structuring of the
  facts -- it takes a bit of getting used to ... but this is just a view after
  all: you can create a view that suits you better.)

  The fact values that appear in blue are actually links to other
  info objects that have been extracted from the STIX package. You see
  two objects called ``PLACEHOLDER``: as it turns out, the STIX package
  references these two objects without actually defining them. Would
  they be imported at a later point of time (identified by identifier
  and namespace of the identifier), the placeholders would
  be overwritten.

* The view also shows the marking that has been extracted and associated
  with this info object and all other info objects extracted from the
  STIX package.

* Curently, there is a single revision of the object in the system. If there
  were more revisions, these would be shown (as well as whether the revision
  you are looking at is the most recent revision).

* This information object is not embedded in another info object; if it were,
  information about these objects would be displayed.


Viewing another info object
---------------------------

Clicking on the value of the third fact with fact term ``TTPs\TTP``, 
we see the facts contained in this info object ... and now there
is also information about info objects in which this info object is
embedded.


.. figure:: images/mantis_view_mandiant_report_ttp_htran.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   Viewing a TTP object. Standard URL for viewing is ``mantis/View/InfoObject/<object-nr>``


Clicking once more, this time into an address object (here, the pre-defined
naming schema did not work and produced the name ``AddressObject (4 facts)`` --
but you can configure additional naming schemas), we view another info object:

.. figure:: images/mantis_view_mandiant_report_ttp_htran_address.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   Viewing an address object

Again, we have information about which objects this particular object is embedded in:
we get two results, and two times the same object, because it has been referenced
two times (once by mistake, it seems.)


Viewing the JSON representation
-------------------------------

Mantis stores objects internally as lists of facts (refer to the
`DINGOS model description`_ to learn more about the internal data model),
but can also produce a JSON representation of each object. 

.. figure:: images/mantis_view_mandiant_report_ttp_htran_json.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   JSON representation of a STIX TTP object. Standard url is ``mantis/View/InfoObject/<object-nr>/json``

Unfortunately, the JSON representation has still a slight problem: in the last few
lines, the identifiers for ``@phase_id`` and ``@kill_chain_id`` would have to be
treated akin to the "normal" references using ``idref``.


Dealing with embeddings of different standards
----------------------------------------------

STIX is very flexible and allows the embedding of other standards, such as Mandiant's OpenIOC.
For example, the `MITRE STIX conversion of APT-1 report`_ contains one version of the "Appendix G",
that contains embedded OpenIOC indicators. The Mantis STIX importer recognizes such occurrences
and hands off to the Mantis OpenIOC importer.

.. figure:: images/mantis_view_infoobject_godocupload.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   STIX indicator with embedded OpenIOC indicator (fact with fact term ``Test_Mechanisms/Test_Mechanism/ioc``).

Clicking on the embedded ``ioc`` object (here, the naming went wrong, it should display the value of the ``short_description`` element
in the IOC) in line ``Test_Mechanisms/Test_Mechanism/ioc`` yields a view of the imported OpenIOC info object.

Searching and viewing results
-----------------------------

We also can search for facts:


.. figure:: images/mantis_search_several_results_ugly_gorilla.PNG
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   Searching for values

The search page allows us to search for values, e.g. the word ``ugly``.
This yields several results. The display shows the info objects in which
the value occurs, the info object type of these objects, and the
fact term under which the value occurs.

Clicking on one of the objects shows the object and marks in red
the occurrence of the searched term.

A look at the admin interface
-----------------------------

Django features a very powerful admin interface. We us it to view and manage
enumerables such as info object types, fact data types, etc.

For example, here the list of info object types in the system.

   Admin overview of the info object types

Access to the info object types via the admin interface is especially
relevant, because naming schemas that govern how objects are named
are defined per info object type.
