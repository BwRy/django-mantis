QUICKSTART
===================================================================================

After installing mantis as described in the installation description,
have a try at the following:
 
 - Browse to::   
   
        127.0.0.1:8000/mantis

  and start looking around:

  - Select a filter for ``stix.mitre.org:STIX_Package``
    in the filter box in the top-right corner. 

  - This will show you all ``STIX_Package``
    objects that are in the system 

  - Click on one of the two objects and start exploring (have a look
    at the screenshots in the documentation for a quick guide through
    the application.)

  You can also have a look at the Django admin interface at::

        127.0.0.1:8000/admin
