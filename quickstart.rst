QUICKSTART
===================================================================================

In the ``django-mantis`` folder, do the following:

- For easy demo usage with SQLite, do::

     (mantis)$ bash quickstart.sh 

  (Note that this uses a SQLite database file located in the ``/tmp`` directory:
  any imports you do in Mantis will therefore not survive a system restart. 
  You can move the location of the SQLite database by modifying
  the line reading ``'/tmp/django-mantis_test.db'`` in ``mantis/settings/local.py``.)

- For usage with exisiting and configured postgresql database, do::

     (mantis)$  bash quickstart_psql 


**The script will ask, whether at this stage, you want to create an administrative
user for Django. Answer with *yes* and provide user name, email address and password**.

In detail, the bash script will do the following:

#) Run the Django ``syncdb`` command, which 

   #) creates tables for the models of all applications that are *not*
      using the Django `South`_ application for database migrations.
   #) asks you for user name, email address and password of an administrative Django user
      (you will need this username and password later to log on)

#) Carry out (initial) database migrations for all MANTIS components
   using the `South`_ migrations that are part of the components' distribution
   (in subdirectory ``migrations``)

#) Configure default naming schemata for the exisiting importer modules
   of MANTIS via calling the command ``mantis_<format>_set_naming`` for
   each such module

#) Carry out the Django ``collect_static`` command, which copies over
   the static files for all applications to the ``static`` folder
   configured in the settings of MANTIS

#) Show you (via the ``less`` command) this file and (after you quit ``less``),
   print the file to the console

#) Start the testing web server running MANTIS via Django's ``runserver`` command
   on port 8000.

Then try out the following:

- Download: http://stix.mitre.org/downloads/APT1-STIX.zip and extract the files

- For the files Mandiant_APT1_Report.xml and Appendix_G_IOCs_Full.xml do
  the following:

  - If you are using postgresql::

      python manage.py mantis_stix_import --settings=mantis.settings.local_psql  --trace\
          --marking_json=quickstart_examples/markings/minimal_marking.json\
          --marking_pfill=source "Mandiant APT 1 Report"\
          <file_path>

  - If you are using sqllite::

      python manage.py mantis_stix_import --settings=mantis.settings.local  --trace\
          --marking_json=quickstart_examples/markings/minimal_marking.json\
          --marking_pfill=source "Mandiant APT 1 Report"\
          <file_path>

  Start with Mandiant_APT1_Report.xml: that goes relatively fast;
  Appendix_G_IOCs_Full.xml will take about 20 minutes or so to import.

  **ATTENTION**: The import of large files takes quite a bit of memory (probably there is a memory leak
  somewhere, which will be ironed out in a future release). Be sure to give the system/virtual machine
  you are running the import of ``Appendix_G_IOCs_Full.xml`` on a fair amount of memory (4 GB definitely
  works).


- Start the server (if the quickstart-script has not started it already for you)
  with 

  - If you are using postgresql::

      python manage.py runserver 8000 --traceback --settings=mantis.settings.local_psql

  - If you are using sqllite::

      python manage.py runserver 8000 --traceback --settings=mantis.settings.local


 
 - Browse to::   
   
        127.0.0.1:8000/mantis/View/InfoObject


  and start looking around:

  - Select a filter for ``stix.mitre.org:STIX_Package``
    in the filter box in the top-right corner. 

  - This will show you all ``STIX_Package``
    objects that are in the system (two, if you imported both ``Mandiant_APT1_Report.xml``
    and ``Appendix_G_IOC_Full.xml``). 

  - Click on one of the two objects and start
    exploring (have a look at the screenshots in the documentation for
    a quick guide through the application.)

  You can also have a look at the Django admin interface at::

        127.0.0.1:8000/admin
